or bumped off Lynette.

That's the person
you need to find.

So... you guys made mistakes.
I fixed them.

out of this.

-Sit down.
Let's wait for the lab results.

For now,
this is just speculation.

the surveillance footage.

A woman was seen entering the
house at the time of the murder.

-Oz, please escort Miss Gillory
to the holding cell.

-Can you refute
anything she said?

Well, we have to be sure.

a botched homicide investigation

of the murder.

- Who is she?
- Lishka Zhang.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.306
A few months ago,
she filed a civil lawsuit

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.350
against one of
Lynette Acosta's clients.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.726
Acosta won the case.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.562
It appears Zhang
didn't take it well.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.106
She started sending
threatening e-mails to Acosta.

three months ago,

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.866
you sued Brian Dimon,

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.076
your boss
at Spatial Technologies.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.079
-He harassed me. For months.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.956
I ran out of ways
to tell him no.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.458
So, one night, he...

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.502
locked me in his office
and assaulted me.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.920
I reported it to the police.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.672
I'm sure you have that
in your file.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.966
"Insufficient evidence."

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:19.344
Couldn't file criminal charges,
so I sued him.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.138
-And you lost.
Is that why you've been

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.348
sending Lynette Acosta
threatening e-mails?

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.601
-I was just questioning
why Lynette Acosta

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.478
chose to be complicit in
the suffering of women like me.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.231
- You were angry at Mrs. Acosta.
- Of course.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.026
-Even though Dimon
was the one who assaulted you?

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.486
-Oh, I am angry with him, too,

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:39.198
but the police failed me
on that front.

yesterday.

-We have you on video.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.668
And 30 minutes
after you arrived,

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.005
Anthony Acosta was dead.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.926
-That's impossible. No. No.

I-I wasn't there yesterday.

I was at home, all day, working.

-No.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.903
-You're clear. Just need to
sign your paperwork,

about Lynette's whereabouts,

but Zhang has no alibi,

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.495
we have her at the scene,
and we have motive.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.829
-Once we make the arrest,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.414
we'll lean on her
for Lynette's location.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.793
Start writing it up.
- Yeah.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.170
-The video has the wrong date
on the timestamp.

-This doesn't concern you
anymore.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.007
-Great.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.095
-Wait.
What are you talking about?

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.639
-That's not from yesterday.
Look at the trees.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.892
The wind is blowing
from south to north.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.314
Wind in the L.A. Basin blows
from the south in the summer,

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.984
specifically mid-July
to September.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.736
Then, in late fall,
winds shift in from the north,

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.989
peaking in January.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.032
So that's got to be
from several months ago.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.701
-How do you know
which way the wind is blowing?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.495
-Have you even looked
at your footage?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.373
You got a church.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.420
Churches face east!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.380
Okay.
Uh, around the 8th century,

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.174
priests started orienting
their churches facing east.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.093
They said it was
based off the designs

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.012
for the Holy Temple
in Jerusalem,

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:29.433
but it's also possible that they
wanted the sunrise behind them

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:33.395
to make themselves appear
more godlike and impressive.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.772
But that's not something
we need to get into right now.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:38.191
-All churches face east?

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.319
And can't the wind
change direction?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.072
-Catholic churches built here
in the 1800s do, so, yes.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.824
And the wind
was definitely blowing

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.659
from the north yesterday.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.995
Aah!

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.124
-She's right. On both counts.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.878
-Someone doctored the video.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:00.965
-See ya!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.592
Good Lord.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.094
-Wait!

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.846
How do you do that?

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.639
-Like I told you,
I don't sleep much.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.183
I watch a lot of documentaries.

remotely explain this.

-I also have an IQ of 160,

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.233
so that might have
something to do with it,

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.902
but you can learn a lot
from a good documentary.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:24.029
You'd be surprised.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.281

00:26:02.144 --> 00:26:05.313
and guess what?
Brian Dimon assaulted her also.

00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:07.523
It's all in there.
Same pattern as before.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:10.151
She begs Acosta to take
action against her client.

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:13.529
I figure Lynette Acosta had
a crisis of conscience,

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.825
was gonna turn on Dimon,
so he did something about it.

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.036
We have motive.
We have a serial criminal.

00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:22.413
Let's go arrest him.
- Stop!

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.374
You have no idea
what you have done.

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.376
We have nothing here.
This letter is inadmissible.

00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:29.504
I can't have this
in my possession.

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:31.047
-What? You're gonna let
him go on a technicality?

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:32.632
-No, these are
not technicalities.

00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:34.884
These are laws,

00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:36.928
principles that I have devoted
my entire life to protecting.

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.179
-Jesus, I thought
my life was sad.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.014
-Your life is sad.

00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.265
You've got shopping carts
from three

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.642
different grocery stores
in your yard.

00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.143
-I wouldn't have to go to
different stores,

00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:45.686
but Safeway has
those weird wheel locks.

00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:47.605
-This is the law.

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:48.898
There is absolutely
nothing here that proves

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:50.274
that Brian Dimon murdered
anyone,

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.609
and even if there was,
guess what?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.111
We can't use it in court
because,

00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:54.779
despite what you may think,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.113
we can't run around breaking
into offices

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.782
and arresting people at whim.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.034
It's not how the law works.

00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:04.497
Right now, the only clear crime
here has been committed by you

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:06.207
and by me
if I let you get away with it.

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:09.544
- But...
- Stop talking.

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.796
Okay.

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.673
This didn't happen.

00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:15.258
You're gonna take
this letter,

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:17.093
and you're gonna put it
back exactly where you found it.

00:27:17.094 --> 00:27:19.972
And if you get caught,
I'm going to arrest you myself.

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:26.185
-And then what?

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:28.605
-And then we're gonna go
talk to Brian Dimon.

00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:37.864
-Mr. Dimon, a few months ago,
you were sued by Lishka Zhang.

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:40.658
- And I won.
- Yes.

00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:42.285
Uh, she wrote to your lawyer.

00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:45.496
In fact, he harassed me
over the course of six...

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:47.331
-This is my first interrogation.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.166
What do we do?
- You don't do anything.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.252
-Is it like a good cop,
bad cop situation?

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.712
You want me to go in there
and flip the table over?

00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:54.964
- No.
- Hmm.

00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:57.258
-She lost her case.

00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:59.427
The jury saw the truth.

00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.721
Lishka Zhang is simply
an employee with a grudge.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:03.639
-Those seem to follow you
around.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.435
Tell me about your relationship
with Sarah Atkinson.

00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:09.521
-When do we get to hit him
with the phone book?

00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:11.606
Never.

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.900
- Hey, how's it coming?
- Let's get ready for his alibi.

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:15.568
Give me a data print-out
for the day of the murder.

00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:17.111
-I'm on it.

00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.195
-Yeah, also tell Daphne
I took one of her lollipops,

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.197
and I feel bad about it.

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.199
- I'm not telling her that.
- I heard her, and thank you!

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.827
-I thought I was here to help
with my lawyer's disappearance,

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.204
not relitigate old claims.

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:30.708
-The Atkinson claims
are not old.

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.209
-Well, if there have been
new claims against me,

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.378
I'm not aware of them.
- Hmm.

00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:37.173
- Yeah.
- I got bad news.

00:28:37.174 --> 00:28:38.841
Dimon wasn't in town
the day of the murder.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:42.136
Wasn't anywhere close.
He was in Fontana.

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:46.057
- You certain?
- Positive.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.351
-Fontana? The Kentucky
of California.

00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:50.227
Fontucky?

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.063
What the hell was he doing
in Fontana?

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:53.356
-Doesn't matter.
He wasn't here.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:59.195
-Look at his shoes.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:02.323
Those are Italian seams,
handcrafted.

00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:04.867
Look at his watch.

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:09.622
That guy is not gonna
be caught dead in Fontana.

00:29:09.623 --> 00:29:11.999
There are only two reasons
you go to Fontana.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.837
Number one, you want to catch
hepatitis at the water park.

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:19.757
Number two, you have to go to
your cousin's bachelorette party

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.133
